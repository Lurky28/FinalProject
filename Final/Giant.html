        <p>The Giant is the second Zombies map in Call of Duty: Black Ops III. It is a remake of the map Der Riese (which is German for "The Giant"), which was previously featured 
            in Call of Duty: World at War and Call of Duty: Black Ops, and is the nineteenth (chronologically the second in the altered timeline) Zombies map overall.</p>
        <p>The map was announced as part of Black Ops III's special Collector Edition, and is accessible to Season Pass owners along with being available as an individual purchase 
            independent of the Season Pass. The map features the return of the Primis characters as they appeared in the map Origins, and continues the story from where it left off.</p>
        <p>Initially, The Giant was only available on next-gen consoles and PC. It later had an individual release for the PlayStation 4[2], Xbox One[3] and PC[4] versions on May 22nd, 
            2016. The PlayStation 3 release was on June 2nd, 2016[5] while the Xbox 360 version of the map was released on July 5th, 2016[6].</p>
