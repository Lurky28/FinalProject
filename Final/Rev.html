        <p>Revelations is the twenty-fourth Zombies map and the final map featured in Call of Duty: Black Ops III. The map takes place within Agartha after the release of the 
            Shadowman from the Summoning Key. In contrast to other maps, the cosmic appearance of Revelations is distinct from other previous maps. The map features recurring gameplay
            elements such as the Guard of Fafnir and the Ragnarok DG-4s, but introduced new features such as the Corruption Engines and a new type of enemy, the Fury. Furthermore, fragments of past maps such as Shangri-La and Origins feature as structural components of the map.</p>
        <p>The Primis crew return as the playable characters. Enemies such as the Panzersoldat, the Parasites and the Spiders also return.</p>
        <p>It was released on September 6th 2016 for the PlayStation 4 and then later released on October 6th 2016 for the Xbox One and PC as part of the Salvation map pack. This was 
            also accessible to Black Ops III Season Pass holders.</p>
